#Counseling Service Platform for Providing Psychological Support

  The platform is a service designed to facilitate interaction between a psychologist and a client. Upon accessing the website, the client gains the ability to book an online appointment with their psychologist. They can select a convenient time slot and immediately pay for the session. The platform also allows for rescheduling or canceling appointments. Additionally, the service sends reminders about upcoming sessions.
  
  The platform offers a variety of useful resources, including articles, videos, and other materials. Under the "Practice" section, clients can access tools to track their emotional states, such as an emotion diary, as well as templates for various psychological exercises. There is also a direct communication button to contact the psychologist, ensuring that clients can reach out with questions or concerns about unfamiliar situations or emotional states.
  
  For psychologists, the platform stores all client-related information. Documents created during each session are organized in one place and sorted by date, allowing the psychologist to easily review notes from previous sessions, even those from 10 sessions ago. Psychologists can set their own schedules, and clients can only book available time slots. The platform also includes a chat feature for ongoing communication with clients, as well as the ability to review and provide feedback on practical assignments.
